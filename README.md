# Quiz 8

### Part 1

My project was inspired by a unique visual art video called *Infinite Zoom Art* created by Arkadia Zoomquilt. The video is ten hours long and shows a continuously zoomed in image that is colorful and changing colors as it zooms in. This art form appeals to me because it shows how a sense of dynamism and visual depth can be created through simple zooms and color changes.

In my project, I plan to draw on this technique to amplify the visual and emotional experience of the viewer. Inspired by this artwork, I want to return to the starting scene at the end of my project to create a complete visual loop. This loop not only demonstrates the infinite unfolding of images, but also symbolizes the continuous flow of time and perception, providing the viewer with an experience that is both immersive and reflective.
